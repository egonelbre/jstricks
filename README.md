This was a presentation given at Tartu StackOverflow Meetup. It was about using 
closures and function manipulation to simplify code.

There is "slides.pdf" that was the presentation itself and slides_code that 
has all the code from slides.

For the examples there are also folders:

* fsm : Finite State Machine
* iota : Simple Counter
* log : Simple logging framework
* rpn : RPN Calculator

If you have any similar implementations in other languages then send them along.
